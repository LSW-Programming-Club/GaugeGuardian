## Description

Gauge Guardian is a revolutionary solution that will transform the way Nebraska approaches infrastructure spending. With Gauge Guardian, every bridge in the state will be equipped with sensors that constantly monitor and measure its deformation. This data is then transmitted to a centralized system, which can analyze the information using previously collected bridge information and identify potential issues before they become major problems. By detecting issues early, Gauge Guardian will helped Nebraska save money on infrastructure spending by avoiding costly repairs or even bridge replacements. With this innovative solution, Nebraska will be able to prioritize its infrastructure spending in a more efficient and cost-effective manner, ensuring that our bridges remain safe and functional for years to come.

- [**Node.js**](https://github.com/nodejs/node) is the runtime used for this project. It was fast and easy to setup quickly for the limited time we had

- [**Javascript**](https://github.com/topics/javascript) - We used javascript because although Typescript is nicer but it is a lot harder to setup a quick development environemt.

- [**Express.js**](https://github.com/expressjs/express) - used as the minimalist web framework to display the web page. It gave me low enough capabilities without going too low that it was hard to develop with.
